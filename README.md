This app uses the Flickr API and iOS Core data to display pictures of locations people desire to visit on a map.

HOW TO USE:

The app is intentionally designed to be easy to use. Begin on the Mapview page, simple drag and navigate to a location you desire to visit. Once located, press and hold on the location to drop a pin. After a pin has been dropped, you may tap the icon to view pictures that were taken in the area of the pin. These pictures are pulled from the Flickr API and stored on the device so the network does not have to be pinged every time a pin is selected. 

After pictures have downloaded from Flickr, the user may select photos they want to delete to make their perfect photo album. Travel on!
